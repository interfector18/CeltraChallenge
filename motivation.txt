This project was made by Denis Zornada and Jasmin Makaj for participation within Celtra November Challenge.

The project is still a work in progress, but has:
- working registration system
- working login system
- a converter that converts Centura code to Java code (some bugs need to be ironed out)

It is hosted on AWS, and a database integration is planned.
It uses html, css, php, and bootstrap.

The main motivation for creating this project was learning new technologies and this is where the 
challenge came in just at the right moment. The main thing we learned is that git version control system is 
a literal life saver, and has saved us from starting over again many time, in addition to making it really
easy for us to work independently of each other.
